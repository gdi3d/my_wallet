# My Wallet (this documentation is not finished yet!)
My Wallet it's a personal project that follows the principle of **eat you own dog food**.

The purpose of the app is to keep track of your transactions for differents accounts, like bank accounts, wallets, socks or any weird place you want.
It uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) on the backend and [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) on top of it to provide a nice RESTful interface.

Includes a nice responsive html website to play with it.
